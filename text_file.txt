I have a pet dog. His name is Max. Max is very fluffy and brown. He has big, floppy ears and a wagging tail. I love him very much.

Max likes to play fetch. I throw his red ball, and he runs fast to catch it. He brings the ball back to me, and we play again. It's so much fun!

He also loves belly rubs. When I pet his belly, he wiggles happily and licks my hand. He's the best dog ever!

Every day, I take Max for a walk. We go to the park. He sniffs around and chases butterflies. I giggle when he tries to catch them!

At night, Max sleeps in his cozy bed. I tuck him in with his favorite blanket. He looks so cute when he snores softly.

I give Max food and fresh water every day. He eats his food quickly and slurps his water happily. Then he gives me a big, slobbery kiss!

I am happy to have Max as my pet. He is my best friend. I love cuddling with him and spending time together. Max makes me smile every day.

Pets are amazing! They give us love and make our days brighter.
